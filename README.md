# QA Model using Tweets 

The model is implemented using huggingface transformers library.

Preprocessing of the model was done and data was cleaned by removing all the unnecessary data such as punctuations, hashtags, etc.,

The data was also tokenized.

A wordcloud was visualized to undertstand the story of the data.

Extractive Question and Answering model is used from transformers library to make a Question and Answer.

Finally the data was looped with a for loop to answer the questions.
